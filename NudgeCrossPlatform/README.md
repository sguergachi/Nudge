# Nudge (Cross-Platform Edition)

A cross-platform productivity monitoring application that uses machine learning to detect when you're losing focus and nudges you back to work.

> "Better control over the PCC can help you catch your mind in the act of wandering and nudge it gently back on task." - Sara Lazar, neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School

## Overview

This is a cross-platform port of the original Nudge project, redesigned to run on **Linux** (and potentially other Unix-like systems). The original Windows version used WinForms/WPF and Windows-specific APIs, while this version uses cross-platform .NET 8 and Linux-compatible tools.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

### 1. NudgeCommon (Shared Library)
- `HarvestData`: Data model for captured activity
- `UdpEngine`: Cross-platform UDP communication
- `IActivityMonitor`: Platform-agnostic activity monitoring interface
- `LinuxActivityMonitor`: Linux implementation using X11 tools

### 2. NudgeHarvester (Data Collection)
- Monitors user activity in real-time
- Tracks:
  - Foreground application
  - Keyboard inactivity time
  - Mouse inactivity time
  - Attention span (time in current app)
- Saves labeled data to CSV for ML training
- Listens on UDP port 11111

### 3. NudgeNotifier (Productivity Nudges)
- Sends periodic notifications
- Prompts user to label their productivity
- Communicates with Harvester via UDP
- Listens on UDP port 22222

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Linux with X11 (tested on Ubuntu/Debian)
- **.NET**: .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- **Display Server**: X11 (Wayland not currently supported)

### Linux Package Dependencies

```bash
# Required for activity monitoring
sudo apt-get install xdotool xprintidle

# Optional for desktop notifications
sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin
```

#### What these tools do:
- **xdotool**: Get active window and process information
- **xprintidle**: Track keyboard/mouse idle time
- **notify-send**: Display desktop notifications

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Nudge/NudgeCrossPlatform
```

### 2. Install .NET 8 SDK

If you don't have .NET 8 installed:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -O dotnet-install.sh
chmod +x dotnet-install.sh
./dotnet-install.sh --channel 8.0
```

Add to your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH"
```

### 3. Build the Projects

```bash
dotnet build
```

## Usage

### Running the Harvester

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd NudgeHarvester
dotnet run
```

The harvester will:
- Monitor your activity continuously
- Listen for commands on UDP port 11111
- Save data to `/tmp/HARVEST.CSV`

### Running the Notifier

Open a **second terminal** and run:

```bash
cd NudgeNotifier
dotnet run
```

By default, it sends a nudge every 5 minutes. To customize the interval:

```bash
dotnet run -- "00:02:00"  # Nudge every 2 minutes
```

### Interactive Commands

**Notifier Commands:**
- `n` - Send a nudge now
- `q` - Quit

**Harvester Commands (via UDP):**
- `SNAP` - Take activity snapshot
- `YES` - Label as productive
- `NO` - Label as not productive
- `QUIT` - Exit harvester

## Data Collection Workflow

1. **Notifier** sends "SNAP" command to **Harvester**
2. **Harvester** captures current activity metrics
3. **Notifier** prompts user: "Were you productive?"
4. User responds Y/N
5. **Notifier** sends "YES" or "NO" to **Harvester**
6. **Harvester** saves labeled data to CSV

## Training the ML Model

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs TensorFlow 2.x, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

### Step 2: Validate Your Data

Before training, check that your CSV is properly formatted:

```bash
python validate_data.py /tmp/HARVEST.CSV
```

This will:
- ✓ Verify column names match model requirements
- ✓ Check data types are correct
- ✓ Show class balance (productive vs not productive)
- ⚠️  Warn about insufficient or imbalanced data

### Step 3: Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py /tmp/HARVEST.CSV
```

The training script will:
- Load and preprocess your labeled data
- Split into training/validation/test sets
- Train a neural network (2 hidden layers with 10 units each)
- Save the model to `./model/productivity_model.keras`
- Report test accuracy

**Minimum data requirements:**
- At least 20 labeled examples
- Examples of BOTH productive AND unproductive behavior
- More data = better predictions (aim for 100+ examples)

### Step 4: Make Predictions

Test the trained model:

```bash
# Interactive mode
python predict.py

# Command line mode
python predict.py <app_hash> <kbd_inactive_ms> <mouse_inactive_ms> <attention_span_ms>
```

Example:
```bash
python predict.py 123456789 5000 2000 45000
```

The model learns to predict productivity based on:
- **Foreground application hash**: Which app you're using
- **Keyboard inactivity**: Time since last keystroke
- **Mouse inactivity**: Time since last mouse movement
- **Attention span**: Time focused on current app

## Differences from Windows Version

| Feature | Windows Version | Linux Version |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| UI Framework | WinForms + WPF | Console-based |
| Window Detection | Win32 API | xdotool + /proc |
| Input Monitoring | MouseKeyHook library | xprintidle |
| .NET Version | .NET Framework 4.x | .NET 8.0 |
| Desktop Notifications | WPF Toast | notify-send |

## Troubleshooting

### "xdotool not found" or "xprintidle not found"

Install the required tools:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xdotool xprintidle
```

### "Could not show desktop notification"

Install libnotify:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin
```

### Harvester can't detect active window

Make sure you're running X11 (not Wayland):
```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
# Should output: x11
```

To switch to X11, log out and select "Ubuntu on Xorg" at the login screen.

### UDP communication not working

- Ensure both Harvester and Notifier are running
- Check firewall settings for localhost UDP ports 11111 and 22222
- Try: `sudo ufw allow 11111/udp` and `sudo ufw allow 22222/udp`

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Wayland support
- [ ] macOS support
- [ ] GUI using Avalonia UI
- [ ] Systemd service for auto-start
- [ ] Real-time ML predictions
- [ ] Web dashboard for analytics
